# 🌦️ Building a Weather Data Pipeline: A Beginner’s Data Engineering Project using Philippine Weather Data

## 📌 Project Overview

This beginner-friendly data engineering and analytics project uses simulated Philippine weather data :
- Data ingestion using `pandas`
- Feature engineering (categorizing rain, wind, temperature)
- Exploratory analysis and grouping
- Visualizations using `matplotlib` and `seaborn`
- Insight storytelling like a real analyst or data engineer

## 🗂️ Data Description

The dataset contains daily weather measurements (June 1–30, 2024) across Philippine regions:
- `Date`
- `Region`
- `Rainfall (mm)`
- `Temperature (°C)`
- `Wind Speed (kph)`

Simulated but realistic, it represents patterns often seen during the Philippine rainy season.

## 📊 Key Insights

- **Region IV-A** had the highest average rainfall.
- **Heavy rain** was most frequent in **Region III**, indicating flood risk.
- **Saturday** was the warmest day on average.
- **Region IX** experienced the most heat.
- A **3-day moving average** showed a mid-month rainfall peak, then tapering off.

---

## 📈 Visualizations

- Bar plots: Rainfall and temperature trends by region/day
- Line chart: Daily rainfall with moving average
- Stacked bar chart: Rainfall category distribution per region

All plots are created with Python libraries `matplotlib` and `seaborn`.

## 🚀 Tools Used

- Python (Google Colab / Jupyter Notebook)
- pandas, matplotlib, seaborn
- CSV data file (manually imported)

---

## 📚 Future Improvements

- Add data from a real weather API (e.g., PAGASA or OpenWeatherMap)
- Expand from 1 month to 6-month/year-long trend analysis
- Apply basic machine learning (rain prediction or region classification)
- Create a real-time weather dashboard using Streamlit
